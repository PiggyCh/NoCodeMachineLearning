# NoCodeMachineLearning
NoCodeMachineLearning（NCML）, To make machine learning available for every one
Implementation plan: 
1.  GUI
NCML-GUI is a GUI for machine learning, no code, just drag and drop, and you can get the result of machine learning.

2. Data Dealing module
NCML-DDM is a module for data dealing, including data cleaning, data preprocessing, data visualization, data analysis, etc.
    [] data reading
    [] data cleaning
    [] data preprocessing
    [] data visualization
    [] data analysis
    [] data saving

3. Machine Learning module
NCML-MLM is a module for machine learning, including machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, model visualization, etc.
